## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Spotify Integration ‚úì
- Implemented client credentials OAuth flow
- Album search API integration
- Artist metadata API integration
- Auto-enrichment during ingestion
- 264 albums enriched with Spotify data

### 2. Enhanced Metadata Fetcher ‚úì
- Cascading logic: Spotify ‚Üí MusicBrainz fallback
- Automatic enrichment during RSS ingestion
- Metadata fields added to database:
  - `spotify_album_id`, `spotify_artist_id`
  - `artist_popularity`, `album_popularity`
  - `album_genres`, `album_cover_url`, `release_date`
  - `metadata_source`, `metadata_fetched_at`

### 3. Database Cleanup ‚úì
- Removed 9 non-target sources
- Kept 8 core prog/rock/metal sources
- Database vacuumed and optimized
- Backup created: `music_scout.db.backup-20251018-104552`

### 4. Content Classification Fixes ‚úì
- **Metal Storm:** Fixed URL-based detection (added `review.php` pattern)
- **MetalSucks:** Fixed artist/album extraction (handle "Review:" prefix)
- Re-classified 20 Metal Storm items from NEWS to REVIEW
- Re-extracted metadata for 8 MetalSucks reviews

### 5. Ingestion & Validation ‚úì
- Ingested from 6 working RSS feeds
- Auto-enrichment operational
- Created source overview report CLI tool
- Validated 389 total reviews

### 6. Historical Scraping Framework ‚úì
- Created `HistoricalScraper` base class
- Evaluated Blabbermouth (blocked - requires Selenium)
- Evaluated Kerrang (blocked - requires Playwright)
- **Decision:** Defer JS scrapers to Phase 5

### 7. Weekly Auto-Ingestion Setup ‚úì
- Created `run_weekly_ingestion.bat` (Windows)
- Created `scheduler.py` (cross-platform Python)
- Created `AUTOMATION_SETUP.md` documentation
- Added `schedule` library to requirements.txt

### 8. Documentation Updates ‚úì
- Updated `new-music-scout-spec.md` with current architecture
- Updated `todo.md` with Phase 3.5 completion status
- Created `AUTOMATION_SETUP.md` guide
- Created `SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-18.md` (this file)

## üéì Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Spotify as primary metadata source** - Much better coverage than MusicBrainz for modern releases
2. **URL-based content classification** - More reliable than title/content parsing alone
3. **Auto-enrichment during ingestion** - Eliminates manual metadata refresh step
4. **Nuclear database rebuild** - Cleaner than incremental fixes

### Challenges Encountered
1. **JavaScript-rendered sites** - Blabbermouth & Kerrang require browser automation
2. **Artist/album extraction** - Still needs improvement for some title formats
3. **Metadata coverage** - 67.5% vs 85% target (acceptable for Phase 3.5)

### Technical Improvements Made
1. Added `review.php` pattern for Metal Storm reviews
2. Added "Review:" prefix handling for MetalSucks titles
3. Added MetalSucks-specific extraction patterns:
   - "Artist Does Something on Album" format
4. Improved content type classification logic

## üìã Next Steps (Recommended Priority)

### Immediate (Phase 3.5 Completion)
1. **Set up Windows Task Scheduler** for weekly ingestion
   - Use `run_weekly_ingestion.bat`
   - Schedule for Sunday 9:00 AM
   - Test the task runs successfully

2. **Monitor first automated run**
   - Check logs after first Sunday
   - Validate new reviews appear
   - Ensure Spotify enrichment works

### Phase 4 (Next 2-3 weeks)
1. **Improve artist/album extraction** for better metadata coverage
   - Target: 85%+ metadata coverage
   - Focus on items currently missing metadata (140 items)

2. **Full Spotify OAuth integration**
   - User authentication (Authorization Code Flow)
   - Playlist management
   - Track search and matching
   - "Add to Playlist" UI workflow

### Phase 5 (Future)
1. **JavaScript scrapers** (if needed)
   - Implement Selenium/Playwright for Blabbermouth
   - Implement Selenium/Playwright for Kerrang
   - Only if 6 sources insufficient

2. **Advanced features**
   - Review analytics & weighted scores
   - Personalized recommendations
   - Weekly email digests
