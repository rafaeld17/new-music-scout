## üêõ Known Issues & Tech Debt

### High Priority
- [ ] **Metadata coverage gaps** - MusicBrainz insufficient (Phase 3.5 addresses)
- [ ] **Too many sources** - Need to focus (Phase 3.5 addresses)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Missing review scores** - RSS feeds don't contain full scores
  - Solution: HTML scraping for full article content
- [ ] **No historical data** - Only recent RSS items (~50 per feed)
  - Solution: Historical scraping (Phase 3.5)
- [ ] **Complex aggregation code** - Built but not aligned with goals
  - Solution: Remove in Phase 5 or repurpose

### Low Priority
- [ ] Pydantic deprecation warnings (non-blocking)
- [ ] FastAPI event handler deprecations (non-blocking)
- [ ] Unicode encoding issues in CLI output
